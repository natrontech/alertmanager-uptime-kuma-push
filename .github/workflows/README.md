# GitHub Workflows

## Overview

Following workflows are implemented in the repository.
[SARIF](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/integrating-with-code-scanning/sarif-support-for-code-scanning) is used to store the results for an analysis of code scanning tools in the Security tab of the repository.

## CodeQL

Action: https://github.com/github/codeql-action

[CodeQL](https://codeql.github.com/) is a semantic code analysis engine that can find security vulnerabilities in codebases. The workflow displays security alerts in the repository's Security tab or in pull requests.

## Dependency Review

Action: https://github.com/actions/dependency-review-action

This action scans the dependency manifest files that change as part of a pull request, revealing known-vulnerable versions of the packages declared or updated in the PR. Pull requests that introduce known-vulnerable packages will be blocked from merging.
It also allows you to define a list of licenses that are allowed or disallowed in the project, and will check if the PR introduces a dependency with a disallowed license.
It also checks the OpenSSF scorecard for all dependencies and allows to warn if a dependency has a low score.

More information can be found in the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/about-dependency-review)

## GolangCI-Lint

Action: https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint-action

[GolangCI-Lint](https://golangci-lint.run/) is a fast Go linters runner. It runs linters in parallel, uses caching, and works on Linux, macOS, and Windows. The workflow runs the linters on the Go code in the repository.

## Gosec

Action: https://github.com/securego/gosec

[Gosec](https://securego.io/) is a security tool that performs static code analysis of Go code. The workflow scans the Go code in the repository for security issues.

## OSV-Scan

Action: https://github.com/google/osv-scanner-action

[OSV-Scan](https://osv.dev/) is a vulnerability database and triage infrastructure for open-source projects. The [OSV-Scanner](https://google.github.io/osv-scanner/) finds vulnerabilities in dependencies of an project and uploads the results to the Security tab of the repository.

## Release

The release workflow includes multiple jobs to create a release of the project. Following jobs are implemented:

| Job                               | GitHub Action                                                                                                                    | Description                                                                                                          |

| `image-provenance`                | [generator_container_slsa3](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator/tree/main/internal/builders/container)       | Generates provenance for the container images                                                                        |

| `verification-with-slsa-verifier` | -                                                                                                                                | Verifying the cryptographic signatures on provenance for all binary releases (only possible if release is published) |

### Go Release

This repository uses [goreleaser](https://goreleaser.com/) to create all the release artifacts. GoReleaser can build and release Go binaries for multiple platforms, create archives/container images/SBOMs and more. All the configuration for the release is stored in the file [.goreleaser.yml](./../../.goreleaser.yml).
For all the release artifacts (`*.tar.gz`, `*.zip`, `*.sbom.json`), provenance is generated using the [SLSA Generic Generator](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator/blob/main/internal/builders/generic/README.md). The provenance file is uploaded to the release assets and can be verified using the `slsa-verifier` tool (see [Release Verification](./../../SECURITY.md#release-verification)).

### Container Release

The multi-arch container images are built using [ko](https://ko.build/) in the [publish-image](../actions/publish-image/action.yaml) action and uploaded to the GitHub Container Registry. The docker image provenance is generated using the [SLSA Container Generator](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator/tree/main/internal/builders/container) and uploaded to the registry. The provenance can be verified using the `slsa-verifier` or `cosign` tool (see [Release Verification](./../../SECURITY.md#release-verification)).

**Credits**: The [publish-image](../actions/publish-image/action.yaml) action is from [Kyverno](https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno).

### Container SBOM

[ko](https://ko.build/features/sboms/) only generates a "minimal" SBOM for the container images (see [comment in GitHub Issue](https://github.com/ko-build/ko/pull/587#issuecomment-1034926085)) and lacks some information (e.g. Licensing information or the `version` field which is set to `devel` instead of the actual version).

To generate a complete SBOM for the container images, the [go-gomod-generate-sbom](https://github.com/CycloneDX/gh-gomod-generate-sbom) action is used instead.

The SBOMs of the container images are uploaded to a separate package registry (see [SBOM](./../../SECURITY.md#sbom) for more information).

## Scorecards

Action: https://github.com/ossf/scorecard-action

[Scorecards](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard) is a tool that provides a security score for open-source projects. The workflow runs the scorecard on the repository and uploads the results to the Security tab of the repository. There is also a report on the OpenSSF website, the link is available in the README file by clicking on the OpenSSF Scorecard badge.

[![OpenSSF Scorecard](https://api.securityscorecards.dev/projects/github.com/natrontech/alertmanager-uptime-kuma-push/badge)](https://securityscorecards.dev/viewer/?uri=github.com/natrontech/alertmanager-uptime-kuma-push)
